  ## Description
  
  [![License: CC0-1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC0_1.0-lightgrey.svg)](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
  
  This project uses Node JS to write a comprehensive ReadMe file for a project from a series of prompts to the user. If a user doesn't enter a reply, the ReadMe will still leave a section so that the information can be written in manually later if necessary.

  ## Questions
  
- Why is project name added to the ReadMe filename?
-   This is because the program is used to create ReadMe's for a variety of projects and this might cause overwriting of other projects' files
-  Are there future fixes you might want to add?
-    We would like to make the license badges more complex with a choice of badge within organisation. We have the data but need to break up the questions and create a lot more complexity
